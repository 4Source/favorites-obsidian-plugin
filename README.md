***Favorites*** lets you manage a global favorites list for both plugins and themes in Obsidian - and keeps it consistent across all your vaults.

Stop re-searching the same plugins or themes in every vault. With one central list, your essential tools and styles are always easy to find. 

# Features
- **Global Favorites for Plugins & Themes** - Mark your go to plugins and themes once and use them in all vaults
- **Ease of Use** - Favorite/unfavorite directly from the Obsidian's plugin and theme details browser
- **Vault Independence** - Favorites are stored globally on your device, not tied to a single vault
